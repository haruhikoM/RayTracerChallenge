# Ray Tracer Challenge in Swift 5

My humble attempts to complete the Ray Tracer Challnge in Swift 5.

http://raytracerchallenge.com

## Task List

- [x] Tuples, Points, and Vectors

	`Tuple` is struct. `Point` and `Vector` are just plain Tuple with different `w` value because I couldn't find out how to make a single constructor returned different type of struct. Should I have used class or enum instead?
	
- [x] Drawing on a Canvas
- [x] Matrices
- [x] Matrix Transformations

	Transformations are implemented as `Matrix` static func. I'm not sure this is a good idea.

- [x] Light and Shading
